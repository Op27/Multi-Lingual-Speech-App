//Today's plan

fix the issue with the connectiivity between 
Added the processing icon 
reactived the display of "ðŸ”Š Playing..." icon

----------
Next step 
1. improve delay in transcription
2. seprate sentences


----------
Next steps
1. make the transcription texts display faster
2. double voices are speeched, sounds howling.

integrated code is drafted
created script.js file to have the basic UI functionalities
created style.css to have a basic visual features
updated the index.html file reflecting above two files


1. Test Existing Endpoints: We need to ensure that each individual endpoint is functioning correctly. This involves testing the /upload_audio, /translate_text, and /synthesize_speech endpoints separately.
2. Integrate Endpoints: Once we confirm that each endpoint works as expected, we can create a new endpoint (or modify an existing one) to chain these processes together. This will allow an audio input to go through transcription, translation, and synthesis in one sequence.
3. User Interface Update: We need to update our user interface to support this new integrated flow. This involves ensuring the language selection made by the user is effectively used in the translation and text-to-speech steps.

After making speech in French, the audio continues with the original English message "in English [translated texts in English]". For the final speech output, we do not need English speech. 


// Summary of Today's Progress:
1. Transcription Integration: Successfully integrated and tested the /upload_audio endpoint in your Flask application, which transcribes audio files to text using Google Speech-to-Text API.
2. Translation Setup: Configured and tested the /translate_text endpoint to translate transcribed text into a desired language using DeepL API, ensuring proper error handling and API key management.
3. Text-to-Speech Synthesis: Implemented and verified the /synthesize_speech endpoint, converting translated text back into speech using Google Text-to-Speech API, and resolved an issue related to voice gender support.

// Prompt for Resuming Development:

"Yesterday, we successfully integrated audio transcription, text translation, and text-to-speech synthesis into a Flask application, using Google Cloud APIs and DeepL. The transcription endpoint /upload_audio converts audio to text, the translation endpoint /translate_text translates this text into a specified language, and the text-to-speech endpoint /synthesize_speech synthesizes the translated text back into audio. Today, I'd like to continue developing this application, focusing on [specific area or feature you want to work on next]. Please assist me in developing this further."


-------------
1. add period for transcribed audio
2. add function to translate from transcribed texts into another language with API
designed prompt to resuming the work in the morning 
chose translation api as LibreTranslate
chose DeepL API for translating texts into another language
obtained api key from DeepL
translation of texts with DeepL is completed
translation test
setup Google text to speech API

-------------
1. decide project framework
    Use Javascript for front-end
    Use Python for back-end 
2. decide IDE for Python programming
3. Check steps for creating project
4. Test weather Flask server is receiving a POST request
5. Backend app.py connected with frontend html.index dropdown

-------------

1. Adding a route in app.py to accept audio files.
2. Flask server is receiving the audio file successfully.
3. Processing these audio files using the Google Speech-to-Text API.
4. Returning the transcribed text.
5. Integrate the Google Speech-to-Text API into your Flask application
6. The Google Cloud Speech library is installed

-------------
//Next step

- Updated code is reflected to python file
- The POSTMAN returned  "transcript": "", which seems to be reaidng the audio file but not translating the speech


-------------
//Todays task

1. Download ffmpeg file -ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip
2. integrate FFmpeg with pydub to convert the audio files to a format that is compatible with the Google Speech-to-Text API.


1. Debug error on reading audio file into text - adjust the existing code

----------------------



---------------------------------

Set up the Google Cloud account 
Set up the environmental variables
Key is downloaded

1. ensure the responses from command prompt are correct
127.0.0.1 - - [23/Jan/2024 15:39:16] "OPTIONS /set_language HTTP/1.1" 200 -
2. Error messag in Cosule tag of inspector "Ensure CORS response header values are valid." 
3. move to the next step

//Next Steps
Next Steps for Your Project
Properly Run Flask Backend:

Verify that your app.py file is correctly set up with the Flask code and doesn't contain any non-Python commands (like pip install Flask).
Run the Flask app using the command python app.py in the terminal. If Python is correctly installed and accessible from the command line, this should start your Flask server.
Troubleshoot Python Path Issue:

Since running the command didn't yield results earlier, you might need to troubleshoot Python path issues.
Check your Python installation and PATH environment variable to ensure the command line can locate and run Python.
Test Flask Server:

Once your Flask server is running, test it by sending a request from a browser or a tool like Postman to the endpoint you've set up.
This will confirm whether the server is receiving and processing requests properly.
Connect Frontend to Backend:

Modify the JavaScript function in your HTML file to send the language selection to your Flask server using the Fetch API, as discussed earlier.
Ensure your JavaScript correctly handles the communication with the Flask backend.
Integration Testing:

Test the complete flow from selecting a language in the frontend dropdown to the backend processing that selection.
Check for any errors in the console and debug as necessary.
Further Development:

Once the basic communication between frontend and backend is established and working, you can proceed with adding more functionality, such as integrating with Google APIs for translation and text-to-speech.
Iterative Testing and Debugging:

Continuously test your application as you add new features. This helps identify and fix issues early in the development process.
